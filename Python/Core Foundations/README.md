# Python Core Foundations: Memory & Design

This "chapter" contains a step-by-step curriculum for mastering the internal mechanics of Python. By following these lessons, you will transition from "writing code" to "architecting systems" with a deep understanding of memory management and Pythonic design.

## 📚 Curriculum Path

1.  **[01_object_references_and_copying.py](./01_object_references_and_copying.py)**: Understand how variables are assigned and the difference between Shallow and Deep copies.
2.  **[02_variables_as_tags_and_mutability.py](./02_variables_as_tags_and_mutability.py)**: The foundational "Variables as Tags" mental model.
3.  **[03_pythonic_design_and_pass_by_object_reference.py](./03_pythonic_design_and_pass_by_object_reference.py)**: How Python handles function arguments and objects under the hood.
4.  **[04_logic_and_search_patterns.py](./04_logic_and_search_patterns.py)**: Mastering logical operations (`all`/`any`) and functional search.
5.  **[05_generators_and_lazy_evaluation.py](./05_generators_and_lazy_evaluation.py)**: Demystifying Generators, `yield`, and the iteration protocol.
6.  **[06_memory_efficiency_comparison.py](./06_memory_efficiency_comparison.py)**: Empirical proof of memory footprints (List vs Tuple vs Set).
7.  **[07_memory_management_and_refcounts.py](./07_memory_management_and_refcounts.py)**: Tracking the "Ghost Tags" and reference counting.
8.  **[08_garbage_collection_and_cycle_detection.py](./08_garbage_collection_and_cycle_detection.py)**: Mastering Generational GC and identifying circular references.

## 🚀 Why this exists
In many languages, variables are boxes. In Python, they are labels. Understanding this distinction is the key to writing bug-free, memory-efficient Python code at an industry-standard level.

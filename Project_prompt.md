**Role & Objective**

You are a senior AI architect and hackathon finalist. Design and **simulate an end-to-end, real-world hackathon project** that is **100% win-worthy** according to the hackathon judging criteria in the shared hackathon guide(innovation, technical depth, feasibility, impact, and presentation quality). 

**Core Goal**

Build a **market-ready AI system** that demonstrates:

* Vector Database usage

* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

* CAG (Context-Aware Generation)

* LangChain and/or LangGraph orchestration

* Multi-agent collaboration

* Integration with modern LLM APIs

The project must be **practically useful**, **commercially viable**, and **technically impressive**, not a toy demo.

---

### Functional Requirements

1. **System Architecture**

* Clearly define the problem statement and target users

* High-level and low-level architecture diagrams (described in text)

* Explicit data flow from ingestion → embedding → retrieval → reasoning → generation

2. **Core Components**

* Vector database (choice justified)

* RAG pipeline with prompt-grounding and citation handling

* CAG layer for dynamic context adaptation

* Multi-agent system with clear agent roles and coordination logic

* LangChain/LangGraph used meaningfully (not superficially)

3. **Code Quality**

* Fully working, end-to-end code

* Self-documenting structure and naming

* Clear inline comments and docstrings

* Modular, extensible, production-style organization

* No unnecessary complexity or boilerplate

4. **Explanation & Documentation**

* Step-by-step explanation of how the system works

* Why each technical choice was made

* Performance, scalability, and cost considerations

* How this system could realistically be deployed or monetized

---

### Hackathon Excellence Criteria (Must Explicitly Optimize For)

* **Innovation**: Clear differentiation from common RAG demos

* **Technical Depth**: Non-trivial use of agents, orchestration, and context control

* **Practical Impact**: Solves a real, valuable problem

* **Clarity**: Judges should “get it” within 2 minutes

* **Demo-Readiness**: Easy to explain, impressive to see live

---

### Constraints & Best Practices

* Apply **high-yield prompt engineering principles**

* Optimize for **signal over verbosity**

* Avoid vague abstractions—be concrete and opinionated

* Follow performance-oriented and scalable design patterns

* Include improvements and optimizations commonly overlooked in beginner projects

---

### Final Deliverables

1. Project overview (problem, solution, value)

2. System architecture explanation

3. Fully explained, production-quality code

4. Hackathon pitch summary (why this wins)
